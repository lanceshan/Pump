Module "TU2"       (component TimerUnit_LDD)
   - TU2_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the property <"Enable in init. code"> is set to 
                "yes" value then the device is also enabled (see the description of the <Enable> method). In this case the 
                <Enable> method is not necessary and needn't to be generated. This method can be called only once. Before the 
                second call of Init the <Deinit> must be called first.
   - TU2_Enable -Enables the component - it starts the signal generation. Events may be generated (see SetEventMask). The 
                method is not available if the counter can't be disabled/enabled by HW.
   - TU2_Disable -Disables the component - it stops signal generation and events calling. The method is not available if the 
                counter can't be disabled/enabled by HW.
   - TU2_SetPeriodTicks -The method sets timer re-initialization period (in timer ticks). This method is available only if the 
                property <"Counter restart"> is switched to 'on-match' value.
   - TU2_GetPeriodTicks -Returns the number of counter ticks before re-initialization. See also method <SetPeriodTicks>. This 
                method is available only if the property <"Counter restart"> is switched to 'on-match' value.
   - TU2_ResetCounter -Resets counter. If counter is counting up then it is set to zero. If counter is counting down then 
                counter is updated to the reload value.   The method is not available if HW doesn't allow resetting of the 
                counter.
   - TU2_GetCounterValue -Returns the content of counter register. This method can be used both if counter is enabled and if 
                counter is disabled. The method is not available if HW doesn't allow reading of the counter.

Module "AS1"       (component Serial_LDD)
   - AS1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" value

                is not necessary and needn't to be generated.
   - AS1_SendBlock -Sends a block of characters. The method returns ERR_BUSY when the previous block transmission is not 
                completed. Method <CancelBlockTransmission> can be used to cancel a transmit operation. This method is 
                available only if the transmitter property is enabled. This method finishes immediately after calling it - it 
                doesn't wait the end of data transmission. Use event <OnBlockSent> to check the end of data transmission.

                characters is received. Method <CancelBlockReception> can be used to cancel a running receive operation. If a 
                receive operation is not in progress (the method was not called or a previous operation has already finished) 
                all received characters will be lost without any notification. To prevent the loss of data call the method 
                immediately after the last receive operation has finished (e.g. from the <OnBlockReceived> event). This method 
                finishes immediately after calling it - it doesn't wait the end of data reception. Use event <OnBlockReceived> 
                to check the end of data reception.
