Module "TU2"       (component TimerUnit_LDD)
   - TU2_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the property <"Enable in init. code"> is set to 
                "yes" value then the device is also enabled (see the description of the <Enable> method). In this case the 
                <Enable> method is not necessary and needn't to be generated. This method can be called only once. Before the 
                second call of Init the <Deinit> must be called first.
   - TU2_Enable -Enables the component - it starts the signal generation. Events may be generated (see SetEventMask). The 
                method is not available if the counter can't be disabled/enabled by HW.
   - TU2_Disable -Disables the component - it stops signal generation and events calling. The method is not available if the 
                counter can't be disabled/enabled by HW.
   - TU2_SetPeriodTicks -The method sets timer re-initialization period (in timer ticks). This method is available only if the 
                property <"Counter restart"> is switched to 'on-match' value.
   - TU2_GetPeriodTicks -Returns the number of counter ticks before re-initialization. See also method <SetPeriodTicks>. This 
                method is available only if the property <"Counter restart"> is switched to 'on-match' value.

Module "AS1"       (component Serial_LDD)
   - AS1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" value 
                then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() method 
                is not necessary and needn't to be generated.
   - AS1_SendBlock -Sends a block of characters. The method returns ERR_BUSY when the previous block transmission is not

                characters is received. Method <CancelBlockReception> can be used to cancel a running receive operation. If a 
                receive operation is not in progress (the method was not called or a previous operation has already finished) 
                all received characters will be lost without any notification. To prevent the loss of data call the method 
                immediately after the last receive operation has finished (e.g. from the <OnBlockReceived> event). This method 
                finishes immediately after calling it - it doesn't wait the end of data reception. Use event <OnBlockReceived> 
                to check the end of data reception.

Module "IIC"       (component InternalI2C)
   - IIC_SendChar -When working as a MASTER, this method writes one (7-bit addressing) or two (10-bit addressing) slave address 
                bytes inclusive of R/W bit = 0 to the I2C bus and then writes one character (byte) to the bus. The slave 
                address must be specified before, by the "SelectSlave" or "SelectSlave10" method or in the component 
                initialization section, "Target slave address init" property. If interrupt service is enabled and the method 
                returns ERR_OK, it doesn't mean that transmission was successful. The state of transmission is obtainable from 
                (OnTransmitData, OnError or OnArbitLost) events.   When working as a SLAVE, this method writes a character to 
                the internal output slave buffer and, after the master starts the communication, to the I2C bus. If no 
                character is ready for a transmission (internal output slave buffer is empty), the Empty character will be sent 
                (see "Empty character" property).
   - IIC_RecvChar -When working as a MASTER, this method writes one (7-bit addressing) or two (10-bit addressing) slave address 
                bytes inclusive of R/W bit = 1 to the I2C bus, then reads one character (byte) from the bus and then sends the 
                stop condition. The slave address must be specified before, by the "SelectSlave" or "SelectSlave10" method or 
                in component initialization section, property "Target slave address init". If interrupt service is enabled and 
                the method returns ERR_OK, it doesn't mean that transmission was finished successfully. The state of 
                transmission must be tested by means of events (OnReceiveData, OnError or OnArbitLost). In case of successful 
                transmission, received data is ready after OnReceiveData event is called.   When working as a SLAVE, this 
                method reads a character from the input slave buffer.
   - IIC_SendBlock -When working as a MASTER, this method writes one (7-bit addressing) or two (10-bit addressing) slave 
                address bytes inclusive of R/W bit = 0 to the I2C bus and then writes the block of characters to the bus. The 
                slave address must be specified before, by the "SelectSlave" or "SlaveSelect10" method or in component 
                initialization section, "Target slave address init" property. If interrupt service is enabled and the method 
                returns ERR_OK, it doesn't mean that transmission was successful. The state of transmission is detectable by 
                means of events (OnTransmitData, OnError or OnArbitLost). Data to be send is not copied to an internal buffer 
                and remains in the original location. Therefore the content of the buffer should not be changed until the 
                transmission is complete. Event OnTransmitData can be used to detect the end of the transmission.  When working 
                as a SLAVE, this method writes a block of characters to the internal output slave buffer and then, after the 
                master starts the communication, to the I2C bus. If no character is ready for a transmission (internal output 
                slave buffer is empty), the "Empty character" will be sent (see "Empty character" property). In SLAVE mode the 
                data are copied to an internal buffer, if specified by "Output buffer size" property.
   - IIC_RecvBlock -When working as a MASTER, this method writes one (7-bit addressing) or two (10-bit addressing) slave 
                address bytes inclusive of R/W bit = 1 to the I2C bus, then reads the block of characters from the bus and then 
                sends the stop condition. The slave address must be specified before, by the "SelectSlave" or "SelectSlave10" 
                method or in component initialization section, "Target slave address init" property. If interrupt service is 
                enabled and the method returns ERR_OK, it doesn't mean that transmission was finished successfully. The state 
                of transmission must be tested by means of events (OnReceiveData, OnError or OnArbitLost). In case of 
                successful transmission, received data is ready after OnReceiveData event is called.   When working as a SLAVE, 
                this method reads a block of characters from the input slave buffer.
   - IIC_SelectSlave -This method selects a new slave for communication by its 7-bit slave address value. Any send or receive 
                method directs to or from selected device, until a new slave device is selected by this method. This method is 
                not available for the SLAVE mode.
